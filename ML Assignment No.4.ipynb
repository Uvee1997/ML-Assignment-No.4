    "   i) The histogram - It is graphical representation of data points that arrrange group of data points into user define\n",
    "                      ages.The term was first introduced by Karl Pearson. To construct a histogram, the first step is to                        \"bin\" (or \"bucket\") the range of values—that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of                         intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as                         consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent and are                         often (but not required to be) of equal size.If the bins are of equal size, a rectangle is erected                         over the bin with height proportional to the frequency—the number of cases in each bin. A histogram                         may also be normalized to display \"relative\" frequencies. Histogram gives rough sense of density of                         the underlying distribution of the data.\n",

Each row in the data table is                                        represented by a marker whose position depends on its values in the columns set on the X and Y                              axes.
